# Project Euler

https://projecteuler.net/
Great website for tricky programming challenges.

This project is an unorganized collection of solutions written in scala. I'm really new to the idea of functional
programming, so almost none of my solutions leverage scala's functional aspects. I'd welcome any suggestions or tips!
